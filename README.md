# Mars news program 

For this module challenge, we were supposed to scrape data from a Mars news site and organize and analyse the data from it. 

Part 1:scrapping text and titles from the Mars News site 

For this part, we were supposed to scrape and extract titles and the preview text from the news site. 
This was done via Splinter and BeautifulSoup. 
1. The first step was connecting to the website by launching the browser using splinter. 
2. The next step was scraping the webiste by using a BeautifulSoup object and extracting the text elememts via it.
3. The third step was storing the scraped results via python structure 

Part 2: Mars weather analysis 

For this part of the assignment, we were focusing on scraping Mars weather data from a Mars Temperature Data site. 
It was divided into multiple sections. The first section was visting the website, storing and then scraping the data using the same methods as was done in the first part of the challenge. The next phase was analayzing the data using Matplotlib and finding stuff such as number of months and what were the coldest and warmest months. The last part was saving the data into a csv file called Mars_Weather_df.csv. 

For the project, I attended one study session on Wednesday, August 23th at 6:00 with Jesse Wright where I had problems with some of the BeautifulSoup functions and also I asked BCS learning assistant for help for the part with turning the data into a csv file.
